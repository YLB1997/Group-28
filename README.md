# MedID
**MedID** is a centralized healthcare system designed to reduce patient wait times and unify medical records of patients across Hospitals/clinics. Patients register via a mobile/web app, receive a unique ID, and can book appointments in advance. Doctors/nurses use the ID to access full medical history of the patient at any connected facility, improving care and efficiency. AI also checks prescriptions that are against the medical history of the patient to ensure treatment safety.
 --MedID-- helps revolutionizing the primitive health care system in Ethiopia by using a modren, time- and cost-efficeint technology.
